    "The Fourier transform is one of the most important discoveries in applied math, with particular importance for the study of partial differential equations. Given that the majority of our models of the physical world are based on PDEs, this makes it important for studying the universe. Of course, it's had a few practical applications as well.\n",

    "$$F_k = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} f_j e^{-i \\omega_k t_j}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes a series of data $f_j$ and produces another series of data $F_k$. The data must be sampled at equidistant points, that is $\\Delta t$ must be constant. The DFT *assumes* the data $[f_0, f_1, \\dots, f_{N-1}]$ is periodic. NB: I am here using the DFT assuming the data is a time signal and we are producing a frequency domain; this can be thought of as sampling a spatial direction $x$ with wavenumbers $k$  The frequencies are given by \n",
